# BU_Lab__Sophomore_Summer
Over the summer of 2019, I was fortunate enough to work in Glynn Holt's Mechanical Engineering lab (Boston University).
I analyzed and manipulated audio and visual data with Python to create a video that visualizes cavitation.

<b>What is cavitation?</b> <br>
Cavitation is the process in which a change in a fluid's pressure to below the its vapor pressure creates a vapor-filled cavity. In this case, the pressure drop is created by forcing water into a narrower rectangular channel (creating areas of higher and lower pressure). These vapor-filled bubbles collapse and generate shock waves. This process can also make noise.<br><br>
Check out a slow motion video showing this process with a glass bottle of water by The Slow Mo Guys on YouTube 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/lj3x2U4CaEs?t=134">here</a>. In the clip, you can see the vapor-filled cavities or "bubbles" form and collapse, producing shock waves that are strong enough to break the glass bottle.<br><br>

<b>Applications of Data Analysis</b><br>
Cavitation causes damage in pipes, boat propellers, pumps, fuel injectors (in cars), and in diesel engines. By understanding the relationship between the water/liquid pressure and the amount and location of the resulting cavitation, we can create machinery that is less prone to cavitation damage. <br><br>

<b>What are you looking at in my video?</b><br>
In the bottom right hand corner of the screen you can see a video (images shown one after another to create a video) of the cavitation process. The water flows from left to right, and you can see bubble cavitation (darker areas) and sheet cavitation (lighter areas) occur.

Mean brightness refers to the normalized mean pixel brightness of each image in the dataset<br>
Mean voltage refers to the measurements VFD (Variable Frequency Drive - this ____)
