# BU_Lab__Sophomore_Summer
Over the summer of 2019, I was fortunate enough to work in Glynn Holt's Mechanical Engineering lab (Boston University).
I analyzed and manipulated audio and visual data with Python to create a video that visualizes cavitation.

<b>What is cavitation?</b> <br>
Cavitation is the process in which a change in a fluid's pressure to below its vapor pressure creates a vapor-filled cavity. In this case, the pressure drop is created by forcing water into a narrower rectangular channel (creating areas of higher and lower pressure). These vapor-filled bubbles collapse and generate shock waves. The collapsing bubbles also produce noise.<br><br>
Check out a slow motion video from The Slow Mo Guys showing this process with a glass bottle of water 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/lj3x2U4CaEs?t=134">here</a>. In the clip, you can see the vapor-filled cavities or "bubbles" form and collapse, producing shock waves that are strong enough to break the glass bottle.<br><br>

<b>Applications of Data Analysis</b><br>
Cavitation causes damage in pipes, boat propellers, pumps, fuel injectors (in cars), and in diesel engines. By understanding the relationship between the water/liquid pressure and the amount and location of the resulting cavitation, we can create machinery that is less prone to cavitation damage. <br><br>

<b>What are you looking at in my video?</b><br>
In the bottom right hand corner of the screen you can see a video (images shown one after another to create a video) of the cavitation process. The water flows from left to right, and you can see bubble cavitation (darker areas) and sheet cavitation (lighter areas) occur.<br><br>
Mean voltage refers to the mean frequency of the Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) which is used to control the speed of the motor that pumps the water.<br><br>

The mean brightness refers to the normalized mean pixel brightness of each image in the dataset. The mean brightness decreases as more cavitation occurs at faster water flow speeds.<br>
