# BU_Lab__Sophomore_Summer
Over the summer of 2019, I was fortunate enough to work in Glynn Holt's Mechanical Engineering lab (Boston University).
I analyzed and manipulated audio and visual data with Python to create a video that visualizes cavitation.

<b>What are you looking at? What is cavitation?</b> <br>
Cavitation,,... <br>
Check out a slow motion video showing this process by The Slow Mo Guys on YouTube 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/lj3x2U4CaEs?t=134">here</a>. In the clip, you can see the vacuum "bubbles" form and collapse, producing shock waves that break the glass.<br>

Mean brightness refers to the normalized mean pixel brightness of each image in the dataset<br>
Mean voltage refers to the measurements VFD (Variable Frequency Drive - this ____)
